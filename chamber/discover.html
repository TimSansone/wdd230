            <h2>Orlando, Florida</h2>

By joining the chamber, businesses can gain access to networking opportunities, educational programs, and advocacy initiatives that can help them achieve their goals </p>
            
            <p>Orlando is a great place to do business because of its thriving economy, diverse population, and supportive business community. The city is home to a wide range of industries, including technology, healthcare, and tourism, which provide ample opportunities for businesses to grow and succeed. Additionally, Orlando has a highly skilled workforce, a low cost of living, and a favorable business climate that makes it an attractive location for businesses of all sizes </p>
        
            <p>There are many exciting places to visit in the Orlando area. </p>
        
            <p>- Walt Disney World is a theme park resort located in Orlando, Florida. It encompasses 30,500 acres, making it approximately the same size as San Francisco1. The park has four world-class theme parks: Disney’s Magic Kingdom Park, Epcot, Disney’s Hollywood Studios, and Disney’s Animal Kingdom Theme Park. The estimated annual attendance at Disney’s Magic Kingdom Park is 17.5 million, followed by Epcot with 11 million, Disney’s Hollywood Studios with 9.9 million, and Disney’s Animal Kingdom with 9.9 million1.

            <p>= Universal Studios is a theme park located in Orlando, Florida, that opened on June 7, 1990. It features numerous rides, attractions, and live shows that are primarily themed to movies, television, and other aspects of the entertainment industry2. The Incredible Hulk Coaster in Universal Islands of Adventure is known for its high speeds and thrilling launch. There are more than 200 engines powering tires all along the launch tube. With so much power needed to launch the coaster, Universal was concerned about brown-outs in Orlando each time the Incredible Hulk started, so they had to get creative. In order to lessen the electricity load, Universal created customized generators with huge flywheels dedicated entirely to powering this coaster.</p>
            
            <p>- Cocoa Beach Pier is a historical landmark on Florida’s Space Coast, stretching 800 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.

The restaurant offers a wide range of menu options, including saki bar offerings, all served with breathtaking oceanfront views.</p>
            
            <p>- Wekiva Springs is a state park located in Apopka, Florida. It is an oasis of nature, just 16 miles from downtown Orlando, one of Florida’s largest cities, and 30 miles from the big tourist attractions. With emerald springs feeding the Wekiwa River and lush tropical hammocks, this unique park is perfect for observing abundant wildlife or cooling off on a summer day. Miles of trails beg to be explored on foot, bike, or horseback, and canoes and kayaks are available on-site. The azure waters of Wekiwa Springs have made it Orange County’s longest-running tourist attraction.</p>
